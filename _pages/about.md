Hi! This is Zichen (Jason) Xu. Welcome to my personal website. I'm striving to keep this page clean and professional. However, if you would like to learn more about me, you can find information in the "story" section, which I hope will be more fun. Here we GO!!

I received my BS degree in Statistics from Beijing Normal University in 2024, and I am currently seeking an advanced degree. If you are interested in working with me, please feel free to contact me directly.
